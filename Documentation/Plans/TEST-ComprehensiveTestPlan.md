## Test Implementation Strategy

### Test Framework Requirements
- **Isolation**: Each test should run in clean environment (temp directories, mock commands)
- **Mocking**: Mock external commands (gh, git, gpg) for reliable testing
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of temp files, directories, and config changes
- **Performance**: Tests should complete quickly (goal: <10s for full suite)
- **CI Integration**: Tests should run reliably in CI environment

### Test Data Management
- **Fixtures**: Pre-created test data for various profile formats and scenarios
- **Generators**: Functions to create test users, projects, and configurations
- **Sandboxing**: All tests operate in isolated temp directories
- **Backup/Restore**: Original configs preserved and restored after testing

### Error Testing Patterns
- **Partial Failures**: Test scenarios where operations partially succeed
- **Resource Constraints**: Test behavior under disk full, permission denied, etc.
- **Race Conditions**: Test concurrent operations and interruptions
- **Invalid Input**: Test all forms of malformed, malicious, and edge-case input

### Integration Test Scenarios
- **Full Workflow**: Complete user onboarding â†’ switching â†’ profile management cycle
- **Migration Scenarios**: Testing upgrade paths from all legacy formats
- **Multi-User Scenarios**: Testing with many users, projects, and complex configurations
- **Cross-Platform**: Testing on different shells, git versions, and environments

## Risk Assessment

### **HIGHEST RISK** (Require immediate testing)
1. **Profile Migration** - Risk of data loss during format upgrades
2. **File Atomicity** - Risk of configuration corruption 
3. **Backward Compatibility** - Risk of breaking existing users
4. **Input Validation** - Risk of command injection or data corruption

### **HIGH RISK** (Important for reliability)
1. **GitHub API Integration** - Risk of auth failures or API changes
2. **Git Configuration** - Risk of unintended repository changes
3. **User Switching Workflow** - Risk of partial switches or confusion

### **MEDIUM RISK** (Important for user experience)
1. **Error Handling** - Risk of unclear error messages or crashes
2. **Edge Cases** - Risk of unexpected behavior with unusual input
3. **Performance** - Risk of slowdowns with large configurations
