# BUGFIX-ProfileReliability - Fix Profile System Technical Issues

## Task ID

BUGFIX-ProfileReliability

## Problem Statement

The profile system has several technical reliability issues that could cause failures with real-world data:

1. Brittle profile storage format (pipe-delimited breaks with pipes in names/emails)
2. No input validation on profile creation
3. Git config detection sometimes fails
4. Silent error handling hides important failures
5. No migration strategy for existing users
6. No conflict resolution for corrupted profiles
7. Performance issues with repeated git commands

## Proposed Solution

Implement robust data handling, comprehensive error handling, input validation, and migration support.

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Robust Profile Storage Format

- [x] Replace pipe-delimited format with base64-encoded values
- [x] Add profile format version for future migrations
- [x] Create profile read/write functions with error handling
- [x] Add profile corruption detection and recovery
- [ ] Test with special characters in names/emails

### Phase 2: Input Validation & Error Handling

- [x] Add comprehensive input validation for usernames, names, emails
- [x] Replace all `2>/dev/null` with proper error handling
- [x] Add detailed error messages for common failure scenarios
- [x] Validate git config values before applying
- [ ] Test error scenarios (no git, corrupted files, etc.)

### Phase 3: Git Config Detection Improvements

- [x] Fix git config detection to reliably capture both name and email
- [x] Add fallback detection logic (local → global → defaults)
- [x] Add git availability checking
- [x] Improve git config parsing reliability
- [ ] Test in various git environments

### Phase 4: Migration & Compatibility

- [x] Add migration detection for users with existing configs
- [x] Create profile migration function for empty profile files
- [x] Handle corrupted profile recovery
- [x] Add profile backup and restore functionality
- [ ] Test upgrade scenarios

### Phase 5: Performance & Caching

- [ ] Cache git config detection results
- [ ] Reduce redundant git command calls
- [ ] Optimize dashboard git config status checks
- [ ] Add performance timing for debugging
- [ ] Test with large numbers of profiles

## Verification Steps

1. **Special Characters**: Test names/emails with pipes, quotes, unicode
2. **Error Scenarios**: Test with no git, corrupted files, invalid input
3. **Migration**: Test upgrading from empty/existing systems
4. **Performance**: Measure command execution times
5. **Real World**: Test with actual user data patterns

## Status

Phases 1-4 Completed - Core Reliability Fixes Implemented

## Notes

These fixes focus on reliability and robustness. UX improvements will be addressed separately after technical foundation is solid.
