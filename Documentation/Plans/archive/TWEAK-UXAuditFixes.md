## Task ID

TWEAK-UXAuditFixes

## Problem Statement

Minor UX issues were identified during audit: mis-rendered header glyphs, incomplete README command coverage, and documentation inconsistencies.

## Proposed Solution

1. Replace invalid header glyph `ï¿½` with a proper emoji (ðŸŽ¯) in `gh-switcher.sh` header comments and runtime output.
2. Update README `Commands` section to list `users`, `remove-user`, `validate`, and other missing commands; ensure examples align.
3. Review README for stray `ghs help` output discrepancies.

## Automated Test Plan

- Run `shellcheck` on `gh-switcher.sh` (manual step) â€“ ensure no new warnings.
- Execute `ghs help` and confirm header renders correctly and README lists all commands.

## Components Involved

- `gh-switcher.sh`
- `README.md`

## Dependencies

None.

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Replace header glyphs in script
- [x] Replace runtime glyphs in script
- [x] Expand README Commands section
- [x] Commit with `docs:` prefix

## Verification Steps

1. Source updated script and run `ghs help`; observe ðŸŽ¯ header.
2. View README rendered markdown; confirm presence of new commands.

## Decision Authority

Autonomous for textual / cosmetic changes.

## Questions/Uncertainties (Blocking)

None.

## Acceptable Tradeoffs

Minor README expansion is acceptable overhead.

## Status

Completed

## Notes

Return-code and stable-ID improvements deferred to later refactor.
