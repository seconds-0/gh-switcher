# UI Enhancement Plan for gh-switcher

## Executive Summary

This document outlines proposed UI improvements for gh-switcher based on a comprehensive audit of all command outputs. The goal is to make every screen maximally useful by showing the right information at the right time, improving discoverability, and reducing the need for multiple commands.

## Analysis Summary

### Key Findings

1. **Information Gaps**: Critical status information (SSH/HTTPS mode, git config, guard hooks) is hidden from the default view
2. **Poor Discoverability**: Users must run multiple commands to understand their current state
3. **Inconsistent Indicators**: Active users and status indicators vary across commands
4. **Outdated Markers**: [NEW] tags on established features create confusion
5. **Missing Context**: Commands don't indicate when they require a git repository

### Design Principles

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential info first, details on demand
- **Contextual Relevance**: Display information relevant to the current state
- **Visual Consistency**: Use consistent markers and formatting across all commands
- **Actionable Output**: Always suggest next steps or fixes for problems

## Command-by-Command Changes

### 1. `ghs` / `ghs status` - Default Status Screen

#### Current Output
```
📍 Current project: gh-switcher
🔐 GitHub CLI user: seconds-0
🔄 Auto-switch: ENABLED

👥 Users:
  1. seconds-0            <assigned>

⚡ Quick actions:
  ghs add current     # Add another GitHub account
  ghs help            # Show all commands

Type 'ghs help' for all commands
```

#### Proposed Output
```
📍 Current project: gh-switcher
🔐 GitHub CLI user: seconds-0
📧 Git config: ✅ Seconds Zero <seconds-0@users.noreply.github.com>
🔄 Auto-switch: ENABLED
🛡️  Guard hooks: INSTALLED

👥 Users:
  1. seconds-0     [SSH] ► Active <assigned>

⚡ Quick actions:
  ghs add current     # Add another GitHub account
  ghs help            # Show all commands
```

#### Why These Changes?

1. **Git Config Display**: Shows current git user.name and user.email with validation
   - ✅ when matching a profile
   - ⚠️ when not matching any profile
   - Critical for understanding commit attribution

2. **Guard Hook Status**: Immediately visible protection status
   - Reduces need to run `ghs guard status`
   - Encourages security best practices

3. **Enhanced User Display**: Shows SSH/HTTPS and active status
   - `[SSH]` or `[HTTPS]` indicates authentication method
   - `► Active` clearly marks which profile is currently in use
   - Reduces confusion about current state

### 2. `ghs users` - User Listing

#### Current Output
```
📋 Available users:
  1. seconds-0 [HTTPS]
  2. work-account [SSH] (github.company.com)
```

#### Proposed Output
```
📋 Available users:
► 1. seconds-0 [HTTPS]
  2. work-account [SSH] (github.company.com)
```

#### Why These Changes?

1. **Active User Indicator**: The `►` marker instantly shows which user is active
   - Matches git config email to profile email
   - Consistent with status display
   - Reduces need to check current state separately

### 3. `ghs help` - Help Screen

#### Current Output
```
