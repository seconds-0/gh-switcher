# Workplan Format and Task Management Process

## Overview
This document defines the structured format for workplans used in the gh-switcher project, based on the existing patterns found in `Documentation/Plans/`.

## Workplan File Structure

### File Naming Convention
- Use format: `TASK-TYPE-Name.md`
- Task types: `FEAT`, `BUGFIX`, `TEST`, `DOCS`, `REFACTOR`
- Examples: `FEAT-DirectoryAutoSwitch.md`, `BUGFIX-ProfileReliability.md`

### Required Sections

```markdown
# TASK-TYPE-Name - Brief Description

## Task ID
TASK-TYPE-Name

## Problem Statement
Clear description of the issue or feature need. Include:
- What problem this solves
- Why it's important
- Current pain points or limitations

## Proposed Solution
High-level approach to solving the problem

## Implementation Details
Technical details and approach, including:
- Core functionality breakdown
- User experience considerations
- Technical implementation notes
- Data storage formats
- API/command changes

## Implementation Checklist
### Phase 1: Description
- [x] Completed item
- [ ] Pending item

### Phase 2: Description
- [ ] More items

(Continue with additional phases as needed)

## Testing Plan
1. Test scenario 1
2. Test scenario 2
3. Verification steps

## Status
Current status options:
- Not Started
- In Progress
- Phases X-Y Completed
- Completed

## Notes
Additional context, considerations, or future enhancements
```

### Optional Sections
- **Why It's Valuable** - For feature requests
- **User Experience** - For UI/UX changes with examples
- **Technical Implementation** - Detailed technical specs
- **Verification Steps** - Acceptance criteria
- **Performance Considerations** - For performance-critical features

## Task Management Process

### 1. Creating New Workplans
1. Create file in `Documentation/Plans/` with proper naming
2. Use the required section structure
3. Start with clear Problem Statement and Proposed Solution
4. Break down Implementation into phases with checkboxes
5. Include comprehensive Testing Plan

### 2. Updating Progress
1. Update checkbox items as work progresses: `- [ ]` â†’ `- [x]`
2. Update Status section to reflect current phase
3. Add notes about blockers or changes in approach
4. Keep Implementation Checklist current with actual work

### 3. Completing Workplans
1. Mark all checklist items as complete
2. Update Status to "Completed"
3. Move file to `Documentation/Plans/archive/`
4. Update any related documentation

### 4. Priority and Risk Management
Use priority levels from test plan:
- **P0 - Data Integrity**: Corrupts or loses user data
- **P1 - Core Workflows**: Blocks daily work  
- **P2 - Security & Permission**: Security leaks, incorrect auth
- **P3 - UX & Performance**: User confusion, slowness >100ms

## Examples of Good Workplans

### Feature Example
See `FEAT-DirectoryAutoSwitch.md` for comprehensive feature planning with:
- Clear problem statement
- Detailed user experience examples
- Technical implementation breakdown
- Phased approach with checkboxes

### Bugfix Example
See `BUGFIX-ProfileReliability.md` for systematic bug resolution:
- Multiple related issues grouped together
- Technical solutions for each issue
- Verification steps for each fix
- Status tracking through phases

### Test Planning Example
See `TEST-ComprehensiveTestPlan.md` for systematic test planning:
- Risk-based prioritization
- Coverage matrix
- Implementation roadmap
- Clear success criteria

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Before Starting Work
1. Create or update workplan with detailed checklist
2. Ensure Testing Plan is comprehensive
3. Review with team if needed

### During Development
1. Update checklist items regularly
2. Note any implementation changes
3. Track blockers or issues in Notes section

### After Completion
1. Verify all checklist items are complete
2. Ensure tests pass per Testing Plan
3. Update Status and move to archive
4. Update related documentation

## Quality Standards

### Workplan Quality
- Clear, specific problem statements
- Actionable implementation steps
- Comprehensive testing coverage
- Realistic phasing and timelines

### Implementation Quality
- Follow project coding standards
- Include appropriate tests (unit, service, integration)
- Meet performance requirements (<100ms for commands)
- Ensure data safety and security

This format ensures consistent planning, tracking, and completion of all project work while maintaining high quality standards.
